<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![](https://github.com/TomMcKenna1/particle-explosions/blob/main/resources/particle_explosion_demo.gif)

Easily create awesome looking particle explosion effects in your html files with this lightweight, performant and customisable script.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To view a demo of this effect on your own machine, follow the steps below.

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/TomMcKenna1/particle-explosion.git
   ```
2. Open demo.html using a browser of your choice


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

### Initialisation

To initialise a particle explosion in your own project, follow the steps below.

1. Include the script in the head of your html, ensuring particle-explosion.js and your html file share the same directory
   ```html
   <script src="particle-explosion.js"></script>
   ```
2. Create a canvas anywhere in the body of your html
   ```html
   <canvas id="demoCanvas"></canvas>
   ```
3. Create a new ParticleExplosion object in your javascript, and link it to the canvas element by passing the element ID
   ```js
   const welcomeExplosion = new ParticleExplosion('demoCanvas');
   ```

If you are stuck, please have a look at the demo files: demo.html, demo.css, demo.js

### Configuration

You can pass an additional argument containing parameters to adjust the particle explosion:
```js
const welcomeExplosion = new ParticleExplosion('demoCanvas', {particleSpacing: 10, margin: 100});
```
The following parameters are currently supported:

 * margin - The margin of the particle sheet.
 * marginTop - The top margin of the particle sheet.
 * marginBottom - The bottom margin of the particle sheet.
 * marginLeft - The left margin of the particle sheet.
 * marginRight - The right margin of the particle sheet.
 * particleSpacing - The spacing between particles.
 * particleColour - The colour of the particles as an array of red, green, blue and alpha values ([r, g, b, a]).
 * particleDrag - The drag of the particles.
 * particleEase - The easing of the particles.
